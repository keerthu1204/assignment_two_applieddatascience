    "shows that emission of greenhouse gas for the year of 2018 in various countries. It is clearly shown that the USA emits higher amounts of greenhouse gas when compared to others. China is in next place. Most of the developed countries play a key role in emitting these greenhouse gasses. It clearly shown that some country has less forest areas and produce a smaller number of harmful gases. Mainly developed countries are dominating in producing greenhouse gas and developing country have higher amount of forest area when compared with developing countries."

    "The United Kingdom has various methods to generate electricity and energy like oil, coal, natural gas etc. From Fig4. The trends are shown in a very understandable manner. Electricity access over the years found to be in a fixed trend. In energy production we can notice that from 2010 to 2012 there is decreasing nature but after 2012 it began to increase. Electricity production using oil, coal and gas are in decreasing trend. It is clearly seen that the United Kingdom started to reduce these methods which are harmful for the environment. Anyhow CO2 emission is approximately the same amount over the years."
